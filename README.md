The Circuit is a simple language-agnostic tool for programming process-level concurrency across a cluster


Build and install
-----------------

The Circuit comprises a single, small (about 6MB)  binary.
Assuming the [Go Language](http://golang.org) compiler is installed,
you can build and install the circuit binary with one line:

	go get github.com/gocircuit/circuit/cmd/circuit
